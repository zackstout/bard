He it was that \nin days long gone wedded Harmonia, the daughter of Cypris, and begat Polydorus \nfrom whom they say sprung Labdacus, and Laius from him. I am known as the \ndaughter of Menoeceus, and Creon is my brother by the same mother. Men \ncalled me Jocasta, for so my father named me, and I am married to Laius. \nNow when he was still childless after being wedded to me a long time, he \nwent and questioned Phoebus, craving moreover that our love might be crowned \nwith sons born to his house. But the god said, \"King of Thebes for horses \nfamed! seek not to beget children against the will of heaven; for if thou \nbeget a son, that child shall slay thee, and all thy house shall wade through \nblood.\" But he, yielding to his lust in a drunken fit, begat a son of me, \nand when his babe was born, conscious of his sin and of the god's warning, \nhe gave the child to shepherds to expose in Hera's meadow on mount Cithaeron, \nafter piercing his ankles with iron spikes; whence it was that Hellas named \nhim Oedipus. But the keepers of the horses of Polybus finding him took \nhim home and laid him in the arms of their mistress. So she suckled the \nchild that I had borne and persuaded her husband she was its mother. Soon \nas my son was grown to man's estate, the tawny beard upon his cheek, either \nbecause he had guessed the fraud or learnt it from another, he set out \nfor the shrine of Phoebus, eager to know for certain who his parents were; \nand likewise Laius, my husband, was on his way thither, anxious to find \nout if the child he had exposed was dead. And they twain met where the \nbranching roads to Phocis unite; and the charioteer of Laius called to \nhim, \"Out of the way, stranger, room for my lord!\" But he, with never a \nword, strode on in his pride; and the horses with their hoofs drew blood \nfrom the tendons of his feet. Then-but why need I tell aught beyond the \nsad issue?-son slew father, and taking his chariot gave it to Polybus his \nfoster-father. Now when the Sphinx was grievously harrying our city after \nmy husband's death, my brother Creon proclaimed that he would wed me to \nany who should guess the riddle of that crafty maiden. By some strange \nchance, my own son, Oedipus, guessed the Sphinx's riddle, and so he became \nking of this land and received its sceptre as his prize, and married his \nmother, all unwitting, luckless wretch! nor did I his mother know that \nI was wedded to my son; and I bore him two sons, Eteocles and the hero \nPolyneices, and two daughters as well; the one her father called Ismene, \nthe other, which was the elder, I named Antigone. Now when Oedipus, that \nawful sufferer, learnt that I his wedded wife was his mother too, he inflicted \na ghastly outrage upon his eyes, tearing the bleeding orbs with a golden \nbrooch. But since my sons have grown to bearded men, they have confined \ntheir father closely, that his misfortune, needing as it did full many \na shift to hide it, might be forgotten. He is still living in the palace, \nbut his misfortunes have so unhinged him that he imprecates the most unholy \ncurses on his sons, praying that they may have to draw the sword before \nthey share this house between them. So they, fearful that heaven may accomplish \nhis prayer if they dwell together, have made an agreement, arranging that \nPolyneices, the younger, should first leave the land in voluntary exile, \nwhile Eteocles should stay and hold the sceptre for a year and then change \nplaces. But as soon as Eteocles was seated high in power, he refused to \ngive up the throne, and drove Polyneices into exile from the kingdom; so \nPolyneices went to Argos and married into the family of Adrastus, and having \ncollected a numerous force of Argives is leading them hither; and he is \ncome up against our seven-gated walls, demanding the sceptre of his father \nand his share in the kingdom. Wherefore I, to end their strife, have prevailed \non one son to meet the other under truce, before appealing to arms; and \nthe messenger I sent tells me that he will come. O Zeus, whose home is \nheaven's radiant vault, save us, and grant that my sons may be reconciled! \nFor thou, if thou art really wise, must not suffer the same poor mortal \nto be for ever wretched.

Better far, my son, prize Equality that ever linketh \nfriend to friend, city to city, and allies to each other; for Equality \nis man's natural law; but the less is always in opposition to the greater, \nushering in the dayspring of dislike. For it is Equality that hath set \nup for man measures and divisions of weights and hath distinguished numbers; \nnight's sightless orb, and radiant sun proceed upon their yearly course \non equal terms, and neither of them is envious when it has to yield. Though \nsun and gloom then both are servants in man's interests, wilt not thou \nbe content with thy fair share of thy heritage and give the same to him? \nif not, why where is justice? Why prize beyond its worth the monarch's \npower, injustice in prosperity? why think so much of the admiring glances \nturned on rank? Nay, 'tis vanity. Or wouldst thou by heaping riches in \nthy halls, heap up toil therewith? what advantage is it? 'tis but a name; \nfor the wise find that enough which suffices for their wants.

Then from our lofty \ntowers we saw the Argive host with their white shields leaving Teumessus, \nand, when near the trench, they charged up to our Theban city at the double. \nIn one loud burst from their ranks and from our battlements rang out the \nbattle-cry and trumpet-call. First to the Neistian gate, Parthenopaeus, \nson of the huntress maid, led a company bristling with serried shields, \nhimself with his own peculiar badge in the centre of his targe, Atalanta \nslaying the Aetolian boar with an arrow shot from far. To the gates of \nProetus came the prophet Amphiaraus, bringing the victims on a chariot; \nno vaunting blazon he carried, but weapons chastely plain. Next, prince \nHippomedon came marching to the Ogygian port with this device upon his \nboss, Argus the all-seeing with his spangled eyes upon the watch whereof \nsome open with the rising stars, while others he closes when they set, \nas one could see after he was slain. At the Homoloian gates Tydeus was \nposting himself, a lion's skin with shaggy mane upon his buckler, while \nin his right hand he bore a torch, like Titan Prometheus, to fire the town. \nThy own son Polyneices led the battle 'gainst the Fountain gate; upon his \nshield for blazon were the steeds of Potniae galloping at frantic speed, \nrevolving by some clever contrivance on pivots inside the buckler close \nto the handle, so as to appear distraught. At Electra's gate famed Capaneus \nbrought up his company, bold as Ares for the fray; this device his buckler \nbore upon its iron back, an earth-born giant carrying on his shoulders \na whole city which he had wrenched from its base, hint to us of the fate \nin store for Thebes. Adrastus was stationed at the seventh gate; a hundred \nvipers filled his shield with graven work, as he bore on his left arm that \nproud Argive badge, the hydra, and serpents were carrying off in their \njaws the sons of Thebes from within their very walls. Now I was enabled \nto see each of them, as I carried the watch-word along the line to the \nleaders of our companies. To begin with, we fought with bows and thonged \njavelins, with slings that shoot from far and showers of crashing stones; \nand as we were conquering, Tydeus and thy son on sudden cried aloud, \"Ye \nsons of Argos, before being riddled by their fire, why delay to fall upon \nthe gates with might and main, the whole of you, light-armed and horse \nand charioteers?\" No loitering then, soon as they heard that call; and \nmany a warrior fell with bloody crown, and not a few of us thou couldst \nhave seen thrown to the earth like tumblers before the walls, after they \nhad given up the ghost, bedewing the thirsty ground with streams of gore. \nThen Atalanta's son, who was not an Argive but an Arcadian, hurling himself \nlike a hurricane at the gates, called for fire and picks to raze the town; \nbut Periclymenus, son of the ocean-god, stayed his wild career, heaving \non his head a waggon-load of stone, even the coping torn from the battlements; \nand it shattered his head with the hair and crashed through the sutures \nof the skull, dabbling with blood his cheek just showing manhood's flush; \nand never shall he go back alive to his fair archer-mother, the maid of \nMaenalus.\nThy son then, seeing these gates secure, went on to the next, and \nI with him. There I saw Tydeus and his serried ranks of targeteers hurling \ntheir Aetolian spears into the opening at the top of the turrets, with \nsuch good aim that our men fled and left the beetling battlements: but \nthy son rallied them once more, as a huntsman cheers his hounds, and made \nthem man the towers again. And then away we hastened to other gates, after \nstopping the panic there. As for the madness of Capaneus, how am I to describe \nit? There was he, carrying with him a long scaling-ladder and loudly boasting \nthat even the awful lightning of Zeus would not stay him from giving the \ncity to utter destruction; and even as he spoke, he crept up beneath the \nhail of stones, gathered under the shelter of his shield, mounting from \nrung to rung on the smooth ladder; but, just as he was scaling the parapet \nof the wall, Zeus smote him with a thunderbolt; loud the earth re-echoed, \nand fear seized every heart; for his limbs were hurled from the ladder \nfar apart as from a sling, his head toward the sky, his blood toward earth, \nwhile his legs and arms went spinning round like Ixion's wheel, till his \ncharred corpse fell to the ground. But when Adrastus saw that Zeus was \nleagued against his army, he drew the Argive troops outside the trench \nand halted them. Meantime our horse, marking the lucky omen of Zeus, began \ndriving forth their chariots, and our men-at-arms charged into the thick \nof the Argives, and everything combined to their discomfiture; men were \nfalling and hurled headlong from chariots, wheels flew off, axles crashed \ntogether, while ever higher grew the heaps of slain; so for to-day at least \nhave we prevented the destruction of our country's bulwarks; but whether \nfortune will hereafter smile upon this land, that rests with Heaven; for, \neven as it is, it owes its safety to some deity.\nVictory is fair; and if the gods are growing kinder, it would be \nwell with me.

For I myself excuse you from this risk, \nand will engage my brother in single combat; and if I slay him, will possess \nmy palace without rival, but if I am worsted I will bequeath the city to \nhim.
