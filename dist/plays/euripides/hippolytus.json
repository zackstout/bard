For even in the race of gods \nthis feeling finds a home, even pleasure at the honour men pay them. And \nthe truth of this I soon will show; for that son of Theseus, born of the \nAmazon, Hippolytus, whom holy Pittheus taught, alone of all the dwellers \nin this land of Troezen, calls me vilest of the deities. Love he scorns, \nand, as for marriage, will none of it; but Artemis, daughter of Zeus, sister \nof Phoebus, he doth honour, counting her the chief of goddesses, and ever \nthrough the greenwood, attendant on his virgin goddess, he clears the earth \nof wild beasts with his fleet hounds, enjoying the comradeship of one too \nhigh for mortal ken. 'Tis not this I grudge him, no! why should I? But \nfor his sins against me, I will this very day take vengeance on Hippolytus; \nfor long ago I cleared the ground of many obstacles, so it needs but trifling \ntoil. For as he came one day from the home of Pittheus to witness the solemn \nmystic rites and be initiated therein in Pandion's land, Phaedra, his father's \nnoble wife, caught sight of him, and by my designs she found her heart \nwas seized with wild desire. And ere she came to this Troezenian realm, \na temple did she rear to Cypris hard by the rock of Pallas where it o'erlooks \nthis country, for love of the youth in another land; and to win his love \nin days to come she called after his name the temple she had founded for \nthe goddess. Now, when Theseus left the land of Cecrops, flying the pollution \nof the blood of Pallas' sons, and with his wife sailed to this shore, content \nto suffer exile for a year, then began the wretched wife to pine away in \nsilence, moaning 'neath love's cruel scourge, and none of her servants \nknows what disease afflicts her. But this passion of hers must not fail \nthus. No, I will discover the matter to Theseus, and all shall be laid \nbare. Then will the father slay his child, my bitter foe, by curses, for \nthe lord Poseidon granted this boon to Theseus; three wishes of the god \nto ask, nor ever ask in vain. So Phaedra is to die, an honoured death 'tis \ntrue, but still to die; for I will not let her suffering outweigh the payment \nof such forfeit by my foes as shall satisfy my honour. But lo! I see the \nson of Theseus coming hither-Hippolytus, fresh from the labours of the \nchase. I will get me hence. At his back follows a long train of retainers, \nin joyous cries of revelry uniting and hymns of praise to Artemis, his \ngoddess; for little he recks that Death hath oped his gates for him, and \nthat this is his last look upon the light.

Now life \nhas many pleasures, protracted talk, and leisure, that seductive evil; \nlikewise there is shame which is of two kinds, one a noble quality, the \nother a curse to families; but if for each its proper time were clearly \nknown, these twain could not have had the selfsame letters to denote them. \nSo then since I had made up my mind on these points, 'twas not likely any \ndrug would alter it and make me think the contrary. And I will tell the \ntoo the way my judgment went. When love wounded me, I bethought me how \nI best might bear the smart. So from that day forth I began to hide in \nsilence what I suffered. For I put no faith in counsellors, who know well \nto lecture others for presumption, yet themselves have countless troubles \nof their own. Next I did devise noble endurance of these wanton thoughts, \nstriving by continence for victory. And last when I could not succeed in \nmastering love hereby, methought it best to die; and none can gainsay my \npurpose. For fain I would my virtue should to all appear, my shame have \nfew to witness it. I knew my sickly passion now; to yield to it I saw how \ninfamous; and more, I learnt to know so well that I was but woman, a thing \nthe world detests. Curses, hideous curses on that wife who first did shame \nher marriage-vow for lovers other than her lord! 'Twas from noble families \nthis curse began to spread among our sex. For when the noble countenance \ndisgrace, poor folk of course will think that it is right. Those too I \nhate who make profession of purity, though in secret reckless sinners. \nHow can these, queen Cypris, ocean's child, e'er look their husbands in \nthe face? do they never feel one guilty thrill that their accomplice, night, \nor the chambers of their house will find a voice and speak? This it is \nthat calls on me to die, kind friends, that so I may ne'er be found to \nhave disgraced my lord, or the children I have borne; no! may they grow \nup and dwell in glorious Athens, free to speak and act, heirs to such fair \nfame as a mother can bequeath. For to know that father or mother has sinned \ndoth turn the stoutest heart to slavishness. This alone, men say, can stand \nthe buffets of life's battle, a just and virtuous soul in whomsoever found. \nFor time unmasks the villain soon or late, holding up to them a mirror \nas to some blooming maid.

Thy fate is no uncommon nor \npast one's calculations; thou art stricken by the passion Cypris sends. \nThou art in love; what wonder? so are many more. Wilt thou, because thou \nlov'st, destroy thyself? 'Tis little gain, I trow, for those who love or \nyet may love their fellows, if death must be their end; for though the \nLove-Queen's onset in her might is more than man can bear, yet doth she \ngently visit yielding hearts, and only when she finds a proud unnatural \nspirit, doth she take and mock it past belief. Her path is in the sky, \nand mid the ocean's surge she rides; from her all nature springs; she sows \nthe seeds of love, inspires the warm desire to which we sons of earth all \nowe our being. They who have aught to do with books of ancient scribes, \nor themselves engage in studious pursuits, know how Zeus of Semele was \nenamoured, how the bright-eyed goddess of the Dawn once stole Cephalus \nto dwell in heaven for the love she bore him; yet these in heaven abide \nnor shun the gods' approach, content, I trow, to yield to their misfortune. \nWilt thou refuse to yield? thy sire, it seems, should have begotten thee \non special terms or with different gods for masters, if in these laws thou \nwilt not acquiesce. How many, prithee, men of sterling sense, when they \nsee their wives unfaithful, make as though they saw it not? How many fathers, \nwhen their sons have gone astray, assist them in their amours? 'Tis part \nof human wisdom to conceal the deed of shame. Nor should man aim at too \ngreat refinement in his life; for they cannot with exactness finish e'en \nthe roof that covers in a house; and how dost thou, after falling into \nso deep a pit, think to escape? Nay, if thou hast more of good than bad, \nthou wilt fare exceeding well, thy human nature considered. O cease, my \ndarling child, from evil thoughts, let wanton pride be gone, for this is \nnaught else, this wish to rival gods in perfectness. Face thy love; 'tis \nheaven's will thou shouldst.

But now as soon as ever we would \nbring this plague into our home we bring its fortune to the ground. 'Tis \nclear from this how great a curse a woman is; the very father, that begot \nand nurtured her, to rid him of the mischief, gives her a dower and packs \nher off; while the husband, who takes the noxious weed into his home, fondly \ndecks his sorry idol in fine raiment and tricks her out in robes, squandering \nby degrees, unhappy wight! his house's wealth.

How could I commit so \nfoul a crime when by the very mention of it I feel myself polluted? Be \nwell assured, woman, 'tis only my religious scruple saves thee.

One thing I have not said, the rest thou hast. Had I \na witness to attest my purity, and were I pitted 'gainst her still alive, \nfacts would show thee on enquiry who the culprit was.

Then \ncame he, telling the same doleful tale to us upon the beach, and with him \nwas a countless throng of friends who followed after. At length he stayed \nhis lamentation and spake: \"Why weakly rave on this wise? My father's commands \nmust be obeyed. Ho! servants, harness my horses to the chariot; this is \nno longer now city of mine.\" Thereupon each one of us bestirred himself, \nand, ere a man could say 'twas done, we had the horses standing ready at \nour master's side. Then he caught up the reins from the chariot-rail, first \nfitting his feet exactly in the hollows made for them. But first with outspread \npalms he called upon the gods, \"O Zeus, now strike me dead, if I have sinned, \nand let my father learn how he is wronging me, in death at least, if not \nin life.\" Therewith he seized the whip and lashed each horse in turn; while \nwe, close by his chariot, near the reins, kept up with him along the road \nthat leads direct to Argos and Epidaurus. And just as we were coming to \na desert spot, a strip of sand beyond the borders of this country, sloping \nright to the Saronic gulf, there issued thence a deep rumbling sound, as \nit were an earthquake, fearsome noise, and the horses reared their heads \nand pricked their ears, while we were filled with wild alarm to know whence \ncame the sound; when, as we gazed toward the wave-beat shore, a wave tremendous \nwe beheld towering to the skies, so that from our view the cliffs of Sciron \nvanished, for it hid the isthmus and the rock of Asclepius; then swelling \nand frothing with a crest of foam, the sea discharged it toward the beach \nwhere stood the harnessed car, and in the moment that it broke, that mighty \nwall of waters, there issued from the wave a monstrous bull, whose bellowing \nfilled the land with fearsome echoes, a sight too awful as it seemed to \nus who witnessed it. A panic seized the horses there and then, but our \nmaster, to horses' ways quite used, gripped in both hands his reins, and \ntying them to his body pulled them backward as the sailor pulls his oar; \nbut the horses gnashed the forged bits between their teeth and bore him \nwildly on, regardless of their master's guiding hand or rein or jointed \ncar. And oft as he would take the guiding rein and steer for softer ground, \nshowed that bull in front to turn him back again, maddening his team with \nterror; but if in their frantic career they ran towards the rocks, he would \ndraw nigh the chariot-rail, keeping up with them, until, suddenly dashing \nthe wheel against a stone, he upset and wrecked the car; then was dire \nconfusion, axle-boxes and linchpins springing into the air. While he, poor \nyouth, entangled in the reins was dragged along, bound by a stubborn knot, \nhis poor head dashed against the rocks, his flesh all torn, the while he \ncried out piteously, \"Stay, stay, my horses whom my own hand hath fed at \nthe manger, destroy me not utterly. O luckless curse of a father! Will \nno one come and save me for all my virtue?\" Now we, though much we longed \nto help, were left far behind. At last, I know not how, he broke loose \nfrom the shapely reins that bound him, a faint breath of life still in \nhim; but the horses disappeared, and that portentous bull, among the rocky \nground, I know not where. I am but a slave in thy house, 'tis true, O king, \nyet will I never believe so monstrous a charge against thy son's character, \nno! not though the whole race of womankind should hang itself, or one should \nfill with writing every pine-tree tablet grown on Ida, sure as I am of \nhis uprightness.
