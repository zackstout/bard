Come, though, let me see; must I confess 'twas all a dream? \nNo, by Zeus! since I really showed his spoils to the Bacchic god. And now \nam I enduring to the full a toil still worse than those. For when Hera \nsent forth a race of Tyrrhene pirates against thee, that thou mightest \nbe smuggled far away, I, as soon as the news reached me, sailed in quest \nof thee with my children; and, taking the helm myself, I stood on the end \nof the stern and steered our trim craft; and my sons, sitting at the oars, \nmade the grey billows froth and foam as they sought thee, my liege, But \njust as we had come nigh Malea in our course, an east wind blew upon the \nship and drove us hither to the rock of Aetna, where in lonely caverns \ndwell the one-eyed children of ocean's god, the murdering Cyclopes. Captured \nby one of them we are slaves in his house; Polyphemus they call him whom \nwe serve; and instead of Bacchic revelry we are herding a godless Cyclops's \nflocks; and so it is my children, striplings as they are, tend the young \nthereof on the edge of the downs; while my appointed task is to stay here \nand fill the troughs and sweep out the cave, or wait upon the ungodly Cyclops \nat his impious feasts. His orders now compel obedience; I have to scrape \nout his house with the rake you see, so as to receive the Cyclops, my absent \nmaster, and his sheep in clean caverns.\nBut already I see my children driving their browsing flocks towards \nme.\nWhat means this? is the beat of feet in the Sicinnis dance the \nsame to you now as when ye attended the Bacchic god in his revelries and \nmade your way with dainty steps to the music of lyres to the halls of Althaea? \n","speaker":"SILENUS"},{"type":"text","value":"The CHORUS OF SATYRS enters, driving a flock of goats and sheep.

Now when that \nhell-cook, god-detested, had everything quite ready, he caught up a pair \nof my companions and proceeded deliberately to cut the throat of one of \nthem over the yawning brazen pot; but the other he clutched by the tendon \nof his heel, and, striking him against a sharp point of rocky stone, dashed \nout his brains; then, after hacking the fleshy parts with glutton cleaver, \nhe set to grilling them, but the limbs he threw into his cauldron to seethe. \nAnd I, poor wretch, drew near with streaming eyes and waited on the Cyclops; \nbut the others kept cowering like frightened birds in crannies of the rock, \nand the blood forsook their skin. Anon, when he had gorged himself upon \nmy comrades' flesh and had fallen on his back, breathing heavily, there \ncame a sudden inspiration to me. I filled a cup of this Maronian wine and \noffered him a draught, saying, \"Cyclops, son of Ocean's god, see here what \nheavenly drink the grapes of Hellas yield, glad gift of Dionysus.\" He, \nglutted with his shameless meal, took and drained it at one draught, and, \nlifting up his hand, he thanked me thus \"Dearest to me of all my guests! \nfair the drink thou givest me to crown so fair a feast.\" Now when I saw \nhis delight, I gave him another cup, knowing the wine would make him rue \nit, and he would soon be paying the penalty. Then he set to singing; but \nI kept filling bumper after bumper and heating him with drink. So there \nhe is singing discordantly amid the weeping of my fellow-sailors, and the \ncave re-echoes; but I have made my way out quietly and would fain save \nthee and myself, if thou wilt. Tell me then, is it your wish, or is it \nnot, to fly from this unsocial wretch and take up your abode with Naiad \nnymphs in the halls of the Bacchic god? Thy father within approves this \nscheme; but there! he is powerless, getting all he can out of his liquor; \nhis wings are snared by the cup as if he had flown against bird-lime, and \nhe is fuddled; but thou art young and lusty; so save thyself with my help \nand regain thy old friend Dionysus, so little like the Cyclops. \n","speaker":"ODYSSEUS"},{"type":"speech","value":"LEADER","speaker":"LEADER"},{"type":"text","value":"Best of friends, would we might see that day, escaping the \ngodless Cyclops!
