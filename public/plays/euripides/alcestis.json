To this hour I have protected him and his. \nI, who am just, chanced on the son of Pheres, a just man, whom I have saved \nfrom Death by tricking the Fates. The Goddesses pledged me their faith \nAdmetus should escape immediate death if, in exchange, another corpse were \ngiven to the Under-Gods.\nOne by one he tested all his friends, and even his father and the \nold mother who bad brought him forth-and found none that would die for \nhim and never more behold the light of day, save only his wife. Now, her \nspirit waiting to break loose, she droops upon his arm within the house; \nthis is the day when she must die and render up her \nlife.\nBut I must leave this Palace's dear roof, for fear pollution soil \nme in the house.\nSee!
