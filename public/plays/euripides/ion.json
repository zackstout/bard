To Delphi am I come,\nThis land where Phoebus from his central throne\nUtters to mortals his high strain, declaring\nThe present and the future; this is the cause;\nGreece hath a city of distinguish'd glory,\nWhich from the goddess of the golden lance\nReceived its name; Erechtheus was its king;\nHis daughter, call'd Creusa, to the embrace\nOf nuptial love Apollo strain'd perforce,\nWhere northward points the rock beneath the heights\nCrown'd with the Athenian citadel of Pallas,\nCall'd Macrai by the lords of Attica.\nHer growing burden, to her sire unknown\n(Such was the pleasure of the god,) she bore,\nTill in her secret chamber to a son\nThe rolling months gave birth: to the same cave,\nWhere by the enamour'd god she was compress'd,\nCreusa bore the infant: there for death\nExposed him in a well-compacted ark\nOf circular form, observant of the customs\nDrawn from her great progenitors, and chief\nFrom Erichthonius, who from the Attic earth\nDeriv'd his origin: to him as guards\nMinerva gave two dragons, and in charge\nConsign'd him to the daughters of Aglauros:\nThis rite to the Erechthidae hence remains,\nMid serpents wreathed in ductile gold to nurse\nTheir children. What of ornament she had\nShe hung around her son, and left him thus\nTo perish. But to me his earnest prayer\nPhoebus applied, \"To the high-lineaged sons\nOf glorious Athens go, my brother; well\nThou know'st the city of Pallas; from the cave\nDeep in the hollow rock a new-born babe,\nLaid as he is, and all his vestments with him;\nBring to thy brother to my shrine, and place\nAt the entrance of my temple; of the rest\n(For, know, the child is mine) I will take care.\"\nTo gratify my brother thence I bore\nThe osier-woven ark, and placed the boy\nHere at the temple's base, the wreathed lid\nUncovering, that the infant might be seen.\nIt chanced, as the orient sun the steep of heav'n\nAscended, to the god's oracular seat\nThe priestess entering, on the infant cast\nHer eye, and marvelled, deeming that some nymph\nOf Delphi at the fane had dared to lay\nThe secret burden of her womb: this thought\nPrompts her to move it from the shrine: but soon\nTo pity she resign'd the harsh intent;\nThe impulse of the god secretly acting\nIn favour of the child, that in his temple\nIt might abide; her gentle hand then took it,\nAnd gave it nurture; yet conceived she not\nThat Phoebus was the sire, nor who the mother\nKnew aught, nor of his parents could the child\nGive information. All his youthful years\nSportive he wandered round the shrine, and there\nWas fed: but when his firmer age advanced\nTo manhood, o'er the treasures of the god\nThe Delphians placed him, to his faithful care\nConsigning all; and in this royal dome\nHis hallow'd life he to this hour hath pass'd.\nMeantime Creusa, mother of the child,\nTo Xuthus was espoused, the occasion this:-\nOn Athens from Euboean Chalcis roll'd\nThe waves of war; be join'd their martial toil,\nAnd with his spear repell'd the foe; for this\nTo the proud honour of Creusa's bed\nAdvanc'd; no native, in Achaea sprung\nFrom Aeolus, the son of Jove. Long time\nUnbless'd with children, to the oracular shrine\nOf Phoebus are they come, through fond desire\nOf progeny: to this the god hath brought\nThe fortune of his son, nor, as was deem'd,\nForgets him; but to Xuthus, when he stands\nThis sacred seat consulting, will he give\nThat son, declared his offspring; that the child,\nWhen to Creusa's house brought back, by her\nMay be agnized; the bridal rites of Phoebus\nKept secret, that the youth may claim the state\nDue to his birth, through all the states of Greece\nNamed Ion, founder of the colonies\nOn the Asiatic coast. The laurell'd cave\nNow will I visit, there to learn what fortune\nIs to the boy appointed, for I see\nThis son of Phoebus issuing forth to adorn\nThe gates before the shrine with laurel boughs.\nFirst of the gods I hail him by the name\nOf Ion, which his fortune soon will give him.
