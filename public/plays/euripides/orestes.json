Tantalus, they say, once so prosperous,-and I am not now taunting \nhim with his misfortunes,-Tantalus, the reputed son of Zeus, hangs suspended \nin mid air, quailing at the crag which looms above his head; paying this \npenalty, they say, for the shameful weakness he displayed in failing to \nkeep a bridle on his lips, when admitted by gods, though he was but mortal, \nto share the honours of their feasts like one of them.\nHe it was that begat Pelops, the father of Atreus, for whom the \ngoddess, when she had carded her wool, spun a web of strife, even to the \nmaking of war with his own brother Thyestes. But why need I repeat that \nhideous tale?\nWell, Atreus slew Thyestes' children and feasted him on them; but,-passing \nover intermediate events-from Atreus and Aerope of Crete sprang Agamemnon, \nthat famous chief,-if his was really fame,-and Menelaus. Now it was this \nMenelaus who married Helen, Heaven's abhorrence; while his brother, King \nAgamemnon, took Clytemnestra to wife, name of note in Hellas, and we three \ndaughters were his issue, Chrysothemis, Iphigenia, and myself Electra; \nalso a son Orestes; all of that one accursed mother, who slew her lord, \nafter snaring him in a robe that had no outlet. Her reason a maiden's lips \nmay not declare, and so leave that unexplained for the world to guess at. \nWhat need for me to charge Phoebus with wrong-doing, though he instigated \nOrestes to slay his own mother, a deed that few approved; still it was \nhis obedience to the god that made him slay her; I, too, feebly as a woman \nwould, shared in the deed of blood, as did Pylades who helped us to bring \nit about.\nAfter this my poor Orestes fell sick of a cruel wasting disease; \nupon his couch he lies prostrated, and it is his mother's blood that goads \nhim into frenzied fits; this I say, from dread of naming those goddesses, \nwhose terrors are chasing him before them,-even the Eumenides. 'Tis now \nthe sixth day since the body of his murdered mother was committed to the \ncleansing fire; since then no food has passed his lips, nor hath he washed \nhis skin; but wrapped in his cloak he weeps in his lucid moments, whenever \nthe fever leaves him; other whiles he bounds headlong from his couch, as \ncolt when it is loosed from the yoke. Moreover, this city of Argos has \ndecreed that no man give us shelter at his fireside or speak to matricides \nlike us; yea, and this is the fateful day on which Argos will decide our \nsentence, whether we are both to die by stoning, or to whet the steel and \nplunge it in our necks. There is, 'tis true, one hope of escape still left \nus; Menelaus has landed from Troy; his fleet now crowds the haven of Nauplia \nwhere he is come to anchor, returned at last from Troy after ceaseless \nwanderings; but Helen, that \"lady of sorrows,\" as she styles herself, hath \nhe sent on to our palace, carefully waiting for the night, lest any of \nthose parents whose sons were slain beneath the walls of Troy, might see \nher if she went by day, and set to stoning her. Within she sits, weeping \nfor her sister and the calamities of her family, and yet she hath still \nsome solace in her woe; for Hermione, the child she left at home in the \nhour she sailed for Troys-the maid whom Menelaus brought from Sparta and \nentrusted to my mother's keeping,-is still a cause of joy to her and a \nreason to forget her sorrows.\nI, meantime, am watching each approach, against the moment I see \nMenelaus arriving; for unless we find some safety there, we have but feeble \nanchor to ride on otherwise.\nA helpless thing, an unlucky house!
